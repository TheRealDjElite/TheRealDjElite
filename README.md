# 🤙🏽 DJ ELITE™

🎯 Creative Systems Thinker with 20+ years in data operations, QA, and compliance. I’ve worked across eligibility systems, regulatory workflows, and remote teams. I solve problems by design and instinct. Now building with Python, SQL, and AWS on my own terms.

🧠 Promethean | 🎧 Vinyl Manipulator | 💻 PC Nerd | 🎼 Song Architect | 🐙🐶 OctoDog 

I use GitHub the same way I approach vinyl and music production — hands-on, detail-driven, and built for real use, not theory.
