# 🤙🏽 **EliteTheOctoDog™** 🐙🐶

🎯 With over 20 years in data operations, QA, and compliance, I bring a systems mindset rooted in clarity and creativity. I’ve worked across eligibility systems, regulatory workflows, and remote teams. I solve problems by design and instinct. Now building with Python, SQL, and AWS on my own terms.

I use GitHub the same way I approach vinyl and music production: hands-on, detail-driven, and built for real use, not theory.
