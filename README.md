# 🤙🏽 DJ ELITE™

Creative Systems Thinker with 20+ years of experience in structured data environments — from eligibility systems and compliance to QA and remote workflows. I solve problems by design and by instinct. Now moving into data-centric and cloud-supported tools like Python, SQL, and AWS — on my own terms.
