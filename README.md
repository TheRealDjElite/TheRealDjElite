# 📊 QA & Compliance Analyst · Data Validation & Reporting · Excel · SQL · Python · Remote-First

Experienced in data validation, QA, and regulatory compliance across government and small business ops. I build tools that reduce manual work, improve accuracy, and support remote teams with structured workflows and clear documentation.

## 🧩 Working Style
Structured, detail-focused, and results-driven. I catch and fix data issues others miss — especially in high-volume, rules-based systems.

## 🎯 Focus Areas
- Data validation and QA in eligibility and compliance workflows  
- SOPs, audit docs, and remote-ready documentation systems  
- Workflow optimization and peer training tools  
- Structured insights that support decision-making

## 🔨 Portfolio Projects
