# 🤙🏽 **EliteTheOctoDog™** 🐙🐶

🎯 20+ years in data, quality assurance, and compliance. I’ve worked with eligibility systems, public programs, and remote teams. I solve problems with structure and creativity. Now building my own projects using Python, SQL, and AWS.

🧠 Promethean   🎧 Vinyl Manipulator   💻 PC Nerd   🎼 Song Architect

I use GitHub the same way I approach vinyl and music production: hands-on, detail-driven, and built for real use, not theory.
