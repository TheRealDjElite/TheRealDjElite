# 🐙🐶 **EliteTheOctoDog™** 🤙🏽

🧠 Promethean mind in a practical world. I build with structure, clarity, and creative intent.

🎯 Experienced in data operations, quality assurance, and regulatory compliance across government and small business environments. Skilled in resolving complex issues, supporting remote teams, and improving workflows in high-pressure settings. Currently deepening my skills in Excel (PivotTables), Python (automation), SQL (analysis), and AWS (CCP exam pending) to build tools that drive efficiency and better decision-making.

🧩 **Behavioral strength:** Analyzer-type thinker — detail-driven, systems-focused, and motivated by clarity, accuracy, and practical results. I fix what others overlook and thrive on structured problem-solving. *(Based on Predictive Index Behavioral Report)*

💡 This is my learning space. I test ideas, build tools, and document my journey with a focus on usability, structure, and real-world impact.
