📊 Data Analyst · QA + Compliance · Excel · SQL · Python · Remote-First

Experienced in data validation, QA, and regulatory compliance across government and small business ops. I build tools that reduce manual work, improve accuracy, and support remote teams through structured workflows and clear documentation.

🧩 **Working Style**  
Structured, detail-focused, and results-driven. I identify and fix data issues others miss — especially in high-volume, rules-based systems.

🎯 **Focus Areas**  
- Data validation and QA in eligibility and compliance workflows  
- SOPs, audit docs, and remote-ready documentation systems  
- Workflow optimization and peer training tools  
- Structured insights that support decision-making
